# [ABJC](http://abjc.tech/beta) is A Better Jellyfin Client

ABJC is currently  Open Source mainly because I haven't decided on a license yet, but all code is publicly available on [GitHub](https://github.com/ABJC). The App is currently in TestFlight beta and I'm planning to publish it on the App Store in December.

# The ABJC Issues Repo

The repo you are looking at is the ABJC Issues Repo. It exists as a public forum to gather users' feedback and discussions on bugs, missing features or desired enhancements. 

__As a developer I want to make ABJC perfect. I welcome all user ideas and opinions.__

## How to report a bug, missing feature, or suggest an enhancement

1. Open the `Issues` tab above. Search existing issues to see if someone else has already beat you to it. 
2. If someone has, feel free to vote that issue up or add your own feedback in a comment.
3. If not, click the `New Issue` button and explain. 
   -  For bug reports, **please provide your OS version, ABJC version, and if possible, detailed steps to reproduce the bug**.

If you have multiple bugs or requests that are not closely related, please separate them into different issues.
